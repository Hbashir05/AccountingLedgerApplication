# AccountingLedgerApplication
My Java application is an attempt at a back-end representation of what Ledger website would entail. It covers how to put in deposits and payments, and allows the user to view reports of all submitted deposits and payments in a timely order.

I find this particular piece of code interesting because it is very wierd and but also cool as to how you can write a piece of code to write a file and other classes can use that to continue to write the csv file.
